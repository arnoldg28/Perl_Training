##### Subroutine
- sub keyword is used to define a subroutine block
- call by using subroutine name
- Function call is made bu using the subroutine name
- arguments can be sent
- Can return value/s
- @_ <- special array unique to every subr. This contain the arguments
- arguments are sent by reference, meaning changes are reflected back to the original variable

##### Local Variable ##### 

- 'local' <- keyword used to localized variable
- changes are not reflected back to the original variable
- extends visibility to the subroutines called from that subroutine
- Local variables are another way to define a lexical scope

##### Prototyping #####
- inducing certain constraints
- taken into account at compile time
- sub foo(\@@) <- args are array at first and list at the 2nd
