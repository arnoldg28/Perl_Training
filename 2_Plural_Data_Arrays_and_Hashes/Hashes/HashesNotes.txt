#### Hashes - Associative Arrays ####
- unordered list denoted by '%'
- the scalar elements are denoted by and associated key value
- %hash = ("key1","value1","key2","value2");
or
- %hash = ("key1"=>"value1","key2"=>"value2");
-the memory allocation is random

- To access a scalar value use:
	$hash{"key"}

- all the even indexed element are keys
- all odd indexed elements are the values of the keys

Rules:
- the keys in an hash are ALWAYS a string
- the keys should always be unique
- There should no be an undefined key in a hash

#### Keys Function ####
- keys function returns the LIST of keys from hash
- In a scalar context, the NUMBER of keys is returned

#### Values Function ####
- values function returns the LIST of values from the hash

#### Each Function ####
- each function return both key and a value from a hash

#### Exist Function ####
- This function test if the key value exist in the hash *need some example

### Delete function ####
- delete function is used to delete a value from a hash or an array
- hash: delete $hash{"key"};
- array: delete $array[1];

#### Conversion from hash to an array ####
- array to hash is done by assigning a hash to an array
